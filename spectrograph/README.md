# spectrograph

a simple spectrograph using pygame + pyaudio + numpy

![spectrograph image](/spectrograph/spectrograph.png "spectrograph")

## notes:
tried matplotlib & PIL (couldn't get opencv to compile with gtk, but it _should_ be possible to get realtime image updates / redraws in a window with opencv)
